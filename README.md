## Methods for regression with functional data

These packages implement various approaches to functional data regression. 

Regression with scalar responses and functional predictors is implemented in functions `pfr`, `peer`, `lpeer`, `fpcr` and `fgam`. For regression with functional responses, see `pffr`, `fosr`, and `fosr2s`.

Regularized covariance and FPC estimation is implemented in functions `fpca.sc`,
`fpca.ssvd`, `fpca.face`, `fpca2s`.

Wavelet-based functional regression methods with scalar responses and functional predictors can be found in the `wcr` and `wnet` functions in the `refund.wave` package.
